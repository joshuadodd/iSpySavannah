# iSpySavannah
ios app for savannah ga tours

Our app will provide a unique and fun tour experience for travelers and locals. It is a cost effective alternative to the larger (bus) tour companies charging between $ and $. When people travel they are always looking for inexpensive ways to get the most out of their vacations. 

MAIN GOAL: 
I Spy Savannah is a tour app that will provide a unique tour experience for travelers and locals. Our tour app will be aimed at a market who are looking for a cost effective alternative, and a more leisurely solution to the local bus tour companies that are currently the biggest competition in the Savannah tour market. The I Spy Savannah app will provide a mapped out tour route with detailed written and audio descriptions of each landmark visited along the tour. To make the tour more exciting for the user AR features are included to gamify the experience by allowing the user to look around the landmark for images to collect. Each image that awaits the user is connected to local or state history and will provide additional fact descriptions making learning about Savannah even more enjoyable. An added bonus challenge is included to find additional images along the route to collect, which will gain bonus points to the users bank while on the tour, or will allow for multiple groups to take a tour and compete for who “spy’s” the most out of the two groups. 

Analysis Of Competitors:
TO DO - Investigate competitors websites and apps to get some insights about their monthly traffic, sources of traffic, website or app rank, geographical location of users, and customer feedback. 

Defining The User Flow:
TO DO - Focusing on the apps primary goal; Explain the steps required to reach your products primary goal. Concentrate more on basic tasks and types of goals your end-users will have when they use your product. 

Necessary Features: ( List particular features for each stage, then prioritize them)
MAIN FEATURE (what is the single most important action that I want my users to accomplish)
 AR : This feature makes taking a historical tour more fun by providing an interactive “I Spy” environment. We will use this to display images that will be collected for landmark coins. It is also something that no other local tours offer. 
ADDITIONAL FEATURES  ( explain why you need each of these features, cross out the least important ones) 
 Geofencing: GPS location based triggers for audio and visual text describing each landmark when the zone has been entered. 
Gamification: Landmark coins are collected for finding images along the tour. Single play will be challenged to find x amount along the way and multiplayer (groups etc.) will be challenged to beat the other team with the amount of coins that have been collected.

Audio: Is this going to be voice over or push and play? If we are going to target the blind or visually impaired voice over might be the better option (look into this) but audio in general would be a nice addition to allow people to skip all the reading??


*Keepsake selfie: Have filters that the user can choose from. Use a border for selfie that came be posted to users FB and or Instagram with branding. This can change for each seasons, Holidays etc. 

*Wayfinder list of nearby places in connection to landmark with a “favorites” option. Point out public restrooms. 

*Add Dot route information so the user can get back downtown from Forsyth Park. 


ELEMENTS - Minimal Design, Intuitive Navigation, Fast but accurate results. 
Keep information architecture as compact and straightforward as possible. 
Simple and more intuitive. Bring out core features and avoid information overload. 
Don’t interfere with default behavior of voiceover. When user goes deeper into the structure of the app, from one screen to another, the focus should be set to a “back” or “close” button. 
(The UX will become clearer as we reduce and prioritise elements)
